## 🚀 Features Implemented

### Multi-Level Logging
```typescript
logger.debug('Detailed debugging info', { context })
logger.info('General application flow', { context })  
logger.warn('Potential issues', { context })
logger.error('Application errors', error, { context })
```

### Context-Aware Logging
```typescript
logger.info('Operation completed', {
  churchId: 'church-123',
  userId: 'user-456', 
  action: 'member_create',
  resourceId: 'member-789',
  metadata: { /* additional data */ }
})
```

### Business Event Tracking
```typescript
businessLoggers.memberCreated(churchId, userId, memberId, memberData)
businessLoggers.expenseReportApproved(churchId, approverId, reportId, amount, requesterId)
```

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
const result = await performanceMonitor.measure('operation', async () => {
  return await expensiveOperation()
}, { churchId, userId })
```

### Automatic tRPC Integration
- All procedures automatically logged
- Request/response timing
- Error capture and reporting
- User context injection

### Security & Audit Logging
```typescript
logger.audit({
  churchId,
  userId,
  action: 'sensitive_operation',
  resourceType: 'member',
  resourceId: 'member-123',
  success: true,
  details: { /* operation details */ }
})
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables Added
```bash
# Logging Configuration
LOG_LEVEL="debug"                    # debug, info, warn, error
LOG_TO_FILE="false"                  # Enable file logging in dev
LOG_PERFORMANCE="false"              # Enable performance logging

# Sentry Integration  
SENTRY_DSN="your-sentry-dsn"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN="your-sentry-dsn"
SENTRY_ORG="your-org"
SENTRY_PROJECT="your-project"
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN="your-token"
```

### Next.js Configuration Updated
- Sentry webpack plugin integration
- Source map uploading for error tracking
- Conditional Sentry configuration

---

## 📊 Log Outputs

### Development Environment
- **Console**: Colorized, human-readable logs with context
- **File**: Optional structured JSON logs
- **Sentry**: Error tracking (if configured)

### Production Environment  
- **Console**: Structured JSON logs
- **Files**: Rotating log files with retention policies
  - `application.log` (10MB, 30 days)
  - `errors.log` (5MB, 60 days)  
  - `performance.log` (10MB, 7 days)
  - `audit.log` (50MB, 365 days)

npx ts-node src/lib/logger/test.ts
```

This tests:
- All log levels
- Context injection

## 📈 Integration Examples

### Existing ExpenseReport Router
The expense reports router has been updated to demonstrate integration:

```typescript
import { logger } from '@/lib/logger'
import { businessLoggers } from '@/lib/logger/business'

// Automatic logging via middleware (no code changes needed)
// Manual business event logging where appropriate
businessLoggers.expenseReportCreated(churchId, userId, reportId, amount, category)
```

### Database Operations
```typescript
import { trackDatabaseOperation } from '@/lib/monitoring/performance'

const members = await trackDatabaseOperation('query', 'members', async () => {
  return await prisma.member.findMany({ where: { churchId } })
}, { churchId, userId })
```
